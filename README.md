# IllegalMap

If you find a bug or want to make a suggestion, then join my Discord server: https://discord.gg/pykzREcAuZ
**I will not consider adding features that are too cheaty, pointless or are just unrelated to this module.**


IllegalMap is a [ChatTriggers](https://www.chattriggers.com) module that scans the dungeon to show the user rooms which wouldn't normally be visibile to them.
Other information such as the found-remainaing-total secrets, score, mimic status and crypts killed are also shown underneath the map so that the user doesn't need to open
the tab list.

IllegalMap is a feature complete dungeon map, meaning that it offers all of the functionality which you would typically see in other maps, with the addition of being able to see unopened rooms.

Note: Due to Hypixel's render distance limitation, not all of the dungeon will be visible from the starting room.

# Installation
##### Prerequisites:
    - Minecraft Java Edition
    - Forge
    - ChatTriggers [Download](https://www.chattriggers.com)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/UnclaimedBloom6/IllegalMap/releases) page on Github and download the "IllegalMap.zip" file from the latest release.

2. In your Downloads folder, find the IllegalMap.zip file, right click it and click "Extract All" to extract its contents into a separate folder which will just be named "IllegalMap". This folder should contain an index.js file, a metadata.json file as well as the rest of the module's files. Click on the IllegalMap folder and hit Ctrl + C to copy it.

3. Go to your ChatTriggers modules folder. This will usually be located under .minecraft/config/ChatTriggers/modules/, but you can find it easily by running the "/ct files" command in-game.

4. While in your modules folder, hit Ctrl + V to paste the IllegalMap folder. If you have an older version of IllegalMap installed, you might be prompted to replace old files with new ones, click replace.

5. If you already have Minecraft open, just run the "/ct load" command and it will reload all of your modules. If you don't have your game open currently, the module will be loaded once you launch it.

6. Run the "/dmap" command to open the config gui.
If the gui does not open, double check that you've installed the module correctly. IllegalMap should appear in the "/ct modules" modules list. If it doesn't, then you haven't installed it correctly.
If IllegalMap is there, then run "/ct console js" to open the js console. If there is a big wall of red text, copy it and send it to me via Discord.


# Features

## Dungeon Preview
IllegalMap automatically scans the dungeon as soon as you enter it. After the dungeon has been fully scanned (And the chunks all loaded), it will stop scanning.
By default, all of the rooms before the dungeon begins will be shown clearly, but once the dungeon starts all of the unexplored rooms will be darkened so that they can be distinguished from already explored rooms.
There is an option to show room names and secrets all the time in the Config gui (/dmap), as well as a keybind which will show room names while the key is being held down.

## Dungeon Info
IllegalMap shows useful info about the dungeon underneath the map (By default) including found-remaining-total secrets, crypts, minimum secrets (For S+), score pentalty for deaths, the current score and the mimic status (See screenshots from Dungeon Preview).
The dungeon info can also be configured to display seperately from the map, or remain under the map during clear and seperate upon entering boss.

The mob heads can be configured to have their border colors changed or just appear as small colored dots.

## Dungeon Logs
IllegalMap logs all of the dungeons that you scan. This lets the user view interesting statistics about the dungeon like the average number of secrets per floor, which puzzles or rooms appear the most (or least) or the average number of wither doors in each dungeon.
The command for Dungeon Logs is **"/dlogsnew \[floor]"**. If no floor is given, then it will show the statistics for every dungeon that you have logged.
The room percentages shown for rooms and puzzles show how the percentage of runs which that room appears in.
